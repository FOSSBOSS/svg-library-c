For full details of the original project go to

This is my unholy fork of this project, I couldnt care less about standard practice, or coding conventions.

To compile:
$gcc -g -Wall -lm main.c -o main

added features: Regular polygons with sides > 3. 
                rotate shapes with animateRotate()

Future Features: polyline, gears, star polygons, diamonds. and other features of the svg standard.
